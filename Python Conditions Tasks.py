#Python Conditions Tasks

#1. Check if 10 is bigger than 15 or not


x=10
if x>15:
    print('x is not bigger than 15')

#2. If 10 is not bigger than15 print x is smaller than 15

x=10
if x<15:
    print('x is smaller than 15')
    
#3. In which cases we will use all

x,y,z=2,4,6
if all([x==2,y==4,z==6]):
    print(True)


#4. What is the differences between all , and

x=5
y=6
z=7

#and
if x==5 and y==6 and z==7:
    print('welcome')

#all
if all([x==5 , y==6 , z==7]):
    print('Hello')


#all +([ , , ])


#5. What is the differences between any , or

userrname='Lina'
password=1234
#or
if userrname=='Lina' or password==1234:
    print('Hi Lina')

#any
    if any ([userrname=='Lina' , password==1234]):
        print('not found')

#any +([ , , ])
        



#6. If we need all the conditions to be true we will use ....
'''
L='Lina'
B='Bisherr'
M='Margana'

if all ([L=='Lina',B=='Bisherr',M=='Margana']):
    print(True)
'''


#7. What is the differences between if , elif

#14. if we have this list [2,4,6,8,10] :
    #1. check to see if 4 in this list or not

list=[2,4,6,8,10]
if 4 in list:
    print('4 in this list')

#2. check to see if 4 and 6 in this list on not

list=[2,4,6,8,10]
if 4 and 6 in list:
    print('4,6 in this list')

#3. check to see if 3 or 6 in this list

list=[2,4,6,8,10]
if 3 or 6 in list:
    print('Hello')

#4. check to see if 2 , 4 and 5 in this list Python Conditions Tasks

list=[2,4,6,8,10]
if all([2,4,5]) in list:
    print('Python Conditions tasks')
