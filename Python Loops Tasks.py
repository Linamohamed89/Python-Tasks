#1. Print numbers from 0 to 10 using while

x=0
while 0>10:
    print(x)
    x +=1
    
#2. Print numbers from 0 to 1o using for


for h in range (11):
    print(h)
    
#3. Stop the loop if the number = 5


x >= 5
while x >= 5 : print(x);x +=1


    
#4. Skip the 5 iteration from print


#5. Print multiplication table from 1 to 5
