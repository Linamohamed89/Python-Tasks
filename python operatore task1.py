#Python Operators Tasks


#1 What is the differences between = , ==

x=5
print(x) 
print(x==5)# -->> bool

#2 What do we mean by using !=

x=10
print(x !=10)

#3 What is the operator precedence

#4 Create a variable x with value of 10

x=10
print(x)

#5 Increase x value by 15 using assignment operators

x=10
x +=15
print(x)

#6 Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators

x=25
x /=5
print(x)

#7 Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operators

x = 5.0
x *= 10
print(x)

#8 Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators

x=50.0
x %=3
print(x)

#9 Using python print the module of 11 to 4

x=11
x %=4
print(x)

#10 Print the exponent of 2,3

x=2**3
print(x)


#11 Divide 11 by 3 using python division

x=11
y=3
print(x/y)

#12 Can we divide 11 by 3 and get an integer number ?

x=11
y=3
print(x//y)
